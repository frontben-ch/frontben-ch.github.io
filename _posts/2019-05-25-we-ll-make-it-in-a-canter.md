Why is it for politicians so easy to tell complete and utter lies without any
real consequences? What makes this even worse is when lies like _"We'll meet our
Paris Agreement targets in a canter"_ come from our very own Prime Minister
Scott Morrison who is very outspoken about his christian faith - I wonder if he
has ever read the 10 Commandments... - and is not challenged on these grounds at
all.

Let's analyse this statement. Meeting a target in a canter would imply that,
firstly we are going to meet the target and secondly we're going to do so
easily. In order to fact check these two statements we need to look at what our
obligations under the Paris Agreement are.

Our national targets are an emissions reduction of 26-28% below 2005 levels by
2030\. Our CO2 emissions in 2005 were 605 mio t C02 which would mean by 2030 we
would need to have reduced our emissions to between 447.7 mio t CO2 (26%) and
435.6 mio t CO2 (28%).

Looking at the achievements of the current (just reelected) government over the
last 6 years, I can not share the Prime Minister's optimism with respect to
achieving these goals. Our current estimated emissions are 135.6 mio t CO2 per
quarter (as of June 2018) which equates to annual emissions of 542.4 mio t CO2.
These emissions have been mostly going up since the repeal of the Carbon Tax by
the Abbott goverment in 2013. Incidently, the introduction of the Carbon Tax started a
period of steady decline in CO2 emissions. In other words we are currently
around 10.3% below 2005 levels but year on year emissions have been increasing
despite reductions in emissions in the energy sector.
