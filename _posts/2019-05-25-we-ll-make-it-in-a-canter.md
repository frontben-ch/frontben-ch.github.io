Why is it for politicians so easy to tell complete and utter untruths without
any real consequences? This is even worse when statements like
_"We'll meet our Paris Agreement targets in a canter"_ come from our very own
Prime Minister Scott Morrison who is very outspoken about his christian faith -
I wonder if he has ever read the 10 Commandments, especially the 9th...

Let's analyse this statement. Meeting a target in a canter would imply that,
firstly we are going to meet the target and secondly we're going to do so
easily. In order to fact check these two statements we need to look at what our
obligations under the Paris Agreement are.

Our national targets are an emissions reduction of 26-28% below 2005 levels by
2030\. Our CO&sup2; emissions in 2005 were 605 mio t CO&sup2; which would mean
by 2030 we would need to have reduced our emissions to between 447.7 mio t
CO&sup2; (26%) and 435.6 mio t CO&sup2; (28%).

Looking at the achievements of the current (just reelected) government over the
last 6 years, I can not share the Prime Minister's optimism with respect to
achieving these goals. Our current estimated emissions are 135.6 mio t CO&sup2;
per quarter (as of June 2018) which equates to annual emissions of 542.4 mio t
CO&sup2;.  These emissions have been mostly going up since the repeal of the
Carbon Tax by the Abbott government in 2013. Incidentally, the introduction of
the Carbon Tax started a period of steady decline in CO&sup2; emissions. In
other words we are currently around 10.3% below 2005 levels but year on year
emissions have been increasing despite emissions reductions in the energy
sector due to increased household uptake of solar power and retirement of
ageing coal-fired power-stations.

All this will, in all likelihood, mean an increased focus on emissions reduction in
the transport and agricultural sectors unless - which is highly unlikely with
the current government - and even more aggressive reduction in the power
generation sector is undertaken. I wonder if the electorate in regional
Australia is even aware of the impact this could have on them - would they have
abandoned Labour as they did at the last election knowing this?
