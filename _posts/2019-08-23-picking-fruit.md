Our Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack came with some profound wisdom the
other day whilst acting as Prime Minister during Scott Morrison's trip to the
Pacific Island's Forum. He stated the Pacific Islands would survive the Climate
Crisis because, and I quote, _"many of their workers come here to pick our
fruit"_.

This statement is on par with Peter Dutton's gaffe at talks with Pacific
Island leaders in Port Moresby in 2015. Not realising he was on microphone,
he was overheard saying to Tony Abbott that _"time doesn't mean anything when
you're about to have water lapping at your door"_.

There is a level of both ignorance and complete lack of respect for our Pacific
Island brethren that is so horrific, it beggars belief. What must politicians do
to be punished at the ballot box?

It's time, as Australian voters, that we started applying some prerequisites
for being a duly elected politician. Intelligence? Decency? Altruism? Social
awareness? Empathy? There you have a couple of attributes that instantly come
to mind.

Let's step up at the next election and do something about this!
